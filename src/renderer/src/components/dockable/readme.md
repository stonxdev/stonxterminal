- fix tab children type to allow for null children
- allow orientation props (currently it's implicit only)
- make logo
- rename to trellis?

## bugs

- fix the tab reorder transition bug
- weird sizing sometimes when redocking
- cascading panel resizing issues when pushed against edge
- top and bottom window edge dropzones should have different collision strategy
- panel minsize should consider the minsize of its children
- when drag-resizing beyond the bottom or right edges, dragging abruptly cancels
- sometimes I can get the inlining grandchildren operation to not work as expected (when panel and windows are siblings at the root)
